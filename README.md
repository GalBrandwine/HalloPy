# Hallo - a hand controlled Tello

DJI Tello controller using hand gestures python app

## Docker installation in 3 steps

Tested on ubuntu 19.10

### step 1

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/GalBrandwine/HalloPy
cd HalloPy
```

### step 2

```shell script
docker build --network=host  --tag hallopy:1.3 .
```

(make sure you have docker [installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).)

### step 3

(Make sure you're connected to the TELLO wifi)

```shell script
xhost +  && docker run --rm -it --net=host --ipc=host -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --privileged -v /dev/video0:/dev/video0 --name hallopy hallopy:1.3 
```

## Non docker users

Environment:

* ubuntu 19.10
* python 3.7

Dependency libraries installation:

* pip install av==6.1.2
* pip install opencv-python
* pip install tellopy // Redundant. Added as submodule

### Run

From directory `/HalloPy/`:

```shell script
python ./hallopy/hallo.py
```

## Controller Usage

1. Make sure you have all dependency libraries.
  for great openCV installation tutorial refer to:
  <https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/10/24/ubuntu-16-04-how-to-install-opencv/>
2. Turn on Tello drone and connect to it's wifi
    1. there's no setup.py yet, so in order to run this project, open the project in an IDE and run: hallo.py
3. Application usage:

   ```
    press 'b' - to detect palm ( depend on the environment lights, a Thresh Hold slider tuning may be needed)
    center the detected palm at the center of the detection_frame FOR 5 seconds 
    pressing b again will reset calibration.
   ```

   After center-circle become GREEN (meaning we are now calibrated):

    ```
    press 't' - to take off ( a 3 second hold-up, until drone is in the air)
      after landing - if program is calibrated, press t again to take-off
      
    press 'c' - to toggle drone's control between key-board and detected-palm
      toggling back to keyboard will force drone to hover in the same place
      
    press 'l' - to land ( at any time)

    press 'x' - to adjust background' threshold - for thicker palm recognition
    press 'z' - to adjust background' threshold - for thinner palm recognition
  
    press 'esc' to exit program ( only after drone landed)
    ```
